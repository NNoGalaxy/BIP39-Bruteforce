# BIP39-Bruteforce
# Idea

While learning about crypto currencies and how they work, I came up with the idea of bruteforcing the recovery phrase, which can be 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words long (We're bruteforcing 12 word phrases here)

This will include having to learn about the way the phrases are generated, how crypto currencies work, and decent programming knowledge.

Generate the phrase correctly ✔️


Find a way to check the phrases ❌


Check balance (and other functions) ❌
